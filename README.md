# TNATB Terms and Conditions

Simple webpage for the Terms and Conditions of the **TotallyNotATierritaBot (TNATB)**. It’s meant to look serious... but not really. 🌀

## 🚀 What is this?

A fun, chaotic, and *semi-serious* page explaining how TNATB works, what it can do, and why you might get muted if you annoy Jevil.

The © TotallyNotTierrita notice is just a joke.

It just looks cool, okay?
